## My To-Do List App

# What was the purpose of this project?
This project was a to-do list app. I wanted to be able to work with local storage and being able to store and display the tasks being added by the user. This project was the longest I worked on because I was having trouble with the functionality of the local storage and being able to display the items after a refresh. Eventually I was able to get everything working as it should. The app allows the user to add tasks to their "to-do" list and remove them based on when they were created, oldest being deleted. I would like to continue this project to add some more features. I originally wanted to have every task have a delete buttona and the user would be able to delete whatever task regardless of when it was created.
